# 🌐 VibeCoder

## The autonomous development orchestrator

> *Intelligence isn’t in the machine — it’s in the loop.*

### 🧠 Why VibeCoder exists

Software development never lacked tools — it lacked **orchestration**.  
We have AI that writes code, CI pipelines that test, platforms that deploy.  
But no one has truly **connected everything** into a self-correcting, autonomous cycle.

**VibeCoder** was born from a simple idea:  
> A project shouldn’t stop at code generation. It should live, evolve, repair itself, and deploy — on its own.

### 🚀 What VibeCoder does

VibeCoder turns a written vision into a living project.  
You write a `PROJECT.md` file describing your **vision** and **goals**.  
The system automatically derives **tasks**, executes them with **AI drivers**,  
creates **pull requests**, merges them, triggers **deployments** (Coolify, AWS Amplify, Vercel…),  
monitors **logs**, and when something fails — it launches an **automatic fix task**.

And it keeps looping — until the vision is achieved.

### ⚙️ What VibeCoder is technically

VibeCoder is a **self-hosted autonomous DevOps orchestrator** with a **multi-driver architecture**.  

| Domain | Example Drivers |
|---------|-----------------|
| AI | Codex CLI, Claude, GPT‑4o |
| SCM / GitOps | GitHub, GitLab, Gitea |
| Deployment | Coolify, AWS Amplify, Vercel |
| Monitoring | Coolify Logs, CloudWatch, Grafana |
| QA / Testing | Playwright, Jest, GitHub Actions |

The orchestrator dynamically selects and combines drivers to execute tasks in isolated environments.  
Everything is observable, traceable, and configurable.

### 🔁 The VibeCoder loop

```
Vision → Plan → Code → PR → Tests → Merge → Deploy → Monitor → Fix → Next
```

Each iteration involves specialized agents:
- **Planner** reads the vision and defines tasks.  
- **Engineer** (Codex, Claude, etc.) implements them.  
- **Reviewer** validates and merges PRs.  
- **Deployer** pushes and monitors.  
- **Fixer** repairs issues with oversight.

**3. AI is not an oracle.**  
It experiments, fails, learns, and iterates.

**4. Every error is feedback.**  
Mistakes are signals — not shame.

**5. Evolution is continuous.**  
Every project improves the models and the memory of the system.

### 🧩 Who it’s for

- 🧑f4bb Solo developers — speed up iteration, let the AI handle the boilerplate.  
- 👥 Small teams — automate reviews, deploys, and CI.  
- 🚀 Startups — prototype 10× faster with an autonomous assistant.  
- 🧠 Researchers — study emergent AI collaboration and cognitive loops.

### 🧱 Technical Philosophy

> The future of software development isn’t smarter editors —  
> it’s autonomous feedback loops between **intention**, **action**, and **observation**.

VibeCoder is not a script. It’s a living system — an **AI workshop** of cooperating agents,  
each playing a role: planning, building, testing, deploying, learning.

---

### 🔮 Long‑term vision

To become a **self‑hosting OS for intelligent development**,  
where each project:
- understands its purpose,  
- organizes itself,  
- adapts to its errors,  
- and continues evolving beyond its creator.

### ✊ Manifesto

> We believe creativity shouldn’t drown in complexity.  
> We believe code should heal itself.  
> We believe the loop matters more than the line.  
> We believe the future of code is **auto‑iterative**.

### 🧰 Quick Start (planned)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibecoder.git
cd vibecoder

# Run orchestrator and web UI
docker compose up -d

# Initialize from vision
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/projects/init   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '\'{"slug":"default","vision_md":"Your vision here","goal":"Reach MVP"}\'"
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to supervise your first autonomous project.
